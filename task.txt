1) Create a dump of DB as a archive in .gz format.

2) Design: Create a Posts DB with instances: authors/articles/comments/tags and others. Try to practice CRUD operation.

3) Make your DB as faster as need but not more (create Indexes).

4) There are documents for each student (student_id) across a variety of classes (class_id). Your task is to calculate the class with the best average student performance. This involves calculating an average for each student in each class of all non-quiz assessments and then averaging those numbers to get a class average.
